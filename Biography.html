                Hello, I am Ohisio John. One of the students at Cavendish University pursuing Bachelors of Information Technology. 
                Cavendish University is one of the prestige Universities in Uganda.
                I grew up in Uganda. Initially in Northern Uganda as a refugee in Acholi Camp, Pader District currently known as Agago District. 
                In 2002, Lord Resistance Army burnt down the camp forcing us to flew to Kiryandongo Camp. In Kiryandongo,
                there was no space in the camp given the influx from Acholi-Pii. 
                Block 1 - 5 had to be taken to Kyangwali Refugee Settlement Camp where I lived for 5 years before leaving for Sudan by then and now called South Sudan.
